# Belly Button Biodiversity


In this work , I built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
Click on the link below to see the final dashboard which includes a gauge chart, bubble chart, horizontal bar chart, and a summary of the metadata for the human that the sample came from.
